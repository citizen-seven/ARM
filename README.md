## ARM
### Automatic responding machine

This is a simple bot for [vk.com](https://www.vk.com "vk.com"), who sends an automatic reply for each message. It can be easily deployed to a server. In my case it asks users to telegram me in case of urgent messages, or wait till the evening.

This version ignores chats with more than 2 users.
